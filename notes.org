** TODO What to do about MNPs?
   How to display? Why only one position?
** TODO What about Ile84, Ser85, Ser86?
*** No data or "-" should display or not?
** TODO Fasta sequence for 2EJN doesn't seem to match up with chain1/2
   i.e. 
   fasta:   MEICPAVKR
   chain 1: MKGARVLVL
   chain 2: MRGALLVLA
*** How to know which residue to highlight onClick?

* Here's the information I'd need:
** Sequence for each chain
** Structure
*** I'm now using the 2EJN pdb - is that correct or should I use a different structure?
** Data
   - Sequence to display
   - For each variant
     - Species List:
     - Text you'd like to show when the variant is selected.
     - Correlated variants
   - List of Conserved Regions
   - List of cut sites
   -

** Tech Stack
   If we're not collecting any info on the user
   and Data is relatively small - under 100MB per file
   No need for a backend server

   React app hosted on Github Pages.
   React is popular and familiar to me, I use it at work.
   Github Pages is cheap and simple.

   Reasons we would need to switch - Auth, Data Collection, Complex and Persistant State, Serving large files.
** Development Plan
*** (Invisible) Setup
    Create code repository
    Set up Build/Deploy/Testing
    Data handoff
*** Interactions
**** Show Structure and Sequence (cheap) 
     3D visualization and accompanying static text boxes
     Button to toggle between ribbon and surface structure
**** Show Domestic/Exotic Variants (cheap)
     Button to show all domestic or all exotic variants in both sequences
**** Show Modal w/ information about variant onClick in sequence (cheap)
     show information when clicking on sequence (very expensive)
     highlight region of structure by zooming in (potentially expensive)
**** Button to show all variants by exotic/domestic (cheap)
**** Show Conserved target regions in sequence (cheap)
     show in structure (expensive)
**** Highlight correlated variants (cheap)

* Questions
** Between each SequenceViz?
** Selecting a variant in the structure or sequence will highlight the variant in both locations

* Fel d 1 Viz
** Components
*** ProteinViz
**** Implementation
     http://3dmol.csb.pitt.edu/doc/tutorial-embeddable.html
**** 3D tetrameric crystal structure of Fel d 1
**** Ribbon or Surface Structure
     Button to toggle between
**** Rotation
*** SequenceViz
**** TODO User can select to see all domestic cat variants (from our sequence analysis of 50 cats)
     Unclear what this means
**** States
***** Overview
      User can click on a variant in the structure or sequence to get more details about frequency, mutation type… (e.g. arrow, box; perhaps highlight region of structure by zooming in or creating a pop-out)
      Selecting a variant in the structure or sequence will highlight the variant in both locations (e.g. triangles or zoom or pop-out)
****** TODO What data do I need?

***** Variant (Exotic, Domestic)
      User can select to see all sequence variants (from our sequence analysis of 50 domestic cats & 24 exotic cats)
****** TODO What data do I need?
***** Conserved target regions
      User can select to view the proposed conserved regions of Fel d 1 (based on the sequence analysis) that would be potential CRISPR sgRNA target sites (e.g. highlight conserved regions in the structure and sequences)
User can select to view the cut sites of the panel of 10 sgRNAs that we tested (may be an issue since some sgRNAs target the signal peptide, which isn’t shown in the structure)
****** TODO What data do I need?
***** Correlations/Trends
When the user selects a variant, highlight other correlated variants to visualize trends (e.g. domestic cat variant at CH1 Arg5  variants at CH1 Trp18 & Leu82)
****** TODO What data do I need?
